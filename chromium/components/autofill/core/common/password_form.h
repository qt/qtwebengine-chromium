// The PasswordForm struct encapsulates information about a login form,
// which can be an HTML form or a dialog with username/password text fields.
//
// The Web Data database stores saved username/passwords and associated form
// metdata using a PasswordForm struct, typically one that was created from
// a parsed HTMLFormElement or LoginDialog, but the saved entries could have
// also been created by imported data from another browser.
//
// The PasswordManager implements a fuzzy-matching algorithm to compare saved
// PasswordForm entries against PasswordForms that were created from a parsed
// HTML or dialog form. As one might expect, the more data contained in one
// of the saved PasswordForms, the better the job the PasswordManager can do
// in matching it against the actual form it was saved on, and autofill
// accurately. But it is not always possible, especially when importing from
// other browsers with different data models, to copy over all the information
// about a particular "saved password entry" to our PasswordForm
// representation.
//
// The field descriptions in the struct specification below are intended to
// describe which fields are not strictly required when adding a saved password
// entry to the database and how they can affect the matching process.

  // Enum to differentiate between HTML form based authentication, and dialogs
  // using basic or digest schemes. Default is SCHEME_HTML. Only PasswordForms

  // The original "Realm" for the sign-on (scheme, host, port for SCHEME_HTML,

  // for a site. It is only set to a non-empty value during a match of the
  // original stored login/pass and the current observed form if all these
  // statements are true:
  // 1) The full signon_realm is not the same.
  // 2) The registry controlled domain is the same. For example; example.com,
  // m.example.com, foo.login.example.com and www.example.com would all resolve
  // to example.com since .com is the public suffix.
  // 3) The scheme is the same.
  // 4) The port is the same.
  // For example, if there exists a stored password for http://www.example.com
