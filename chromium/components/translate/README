- translate/language detection depends on the CLD library and should only be
used from the renderer to avoid bloating the DLLs on Windows.

- Translate is not allowed to depend on content/, because it is used by iOS.
If dependences on content/ need to be added to Translate, it will have to be
made into a layered component: see
http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/layered-components-design
for more information.
