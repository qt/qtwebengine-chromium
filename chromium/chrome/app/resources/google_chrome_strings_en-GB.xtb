<translation id="8485767968786176057">In this case, the address listed in the certificate does not match the address of the website that your browser tried to go to. One possible reason for this is that your communications are being intercepted by an attacker who is presenting a certificate for a different website, which would cause a mismatch. Another possible reason is that the server is set up to return the same certificate for multiple websites, including the one you are attempting to visit, even though that certificate is not valid for all of those websites. Google Chrome can say for sure that you reached &lt;strong&gt;<ph name="DOMAIN2"/>&lt;/strong&gt;, but cannot verify that that is the same site as &lt;strong&gt;<ph name="DOMAIN"/>&lt;/strong&gt; which you intended to reach.
