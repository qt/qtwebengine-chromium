// The cookie monster is the system for storing and retrieving cookies. It has
// an in-memory list of all cookies, and synchronizes non-session cookies to an
// optional permanent storage that implements the PersistentCookieStore
// interface.
//
// This class IS thread-safe. Normally, it is only used on the I/O thread, but
// is also accessed directly through Automation for UI testing.
//
// All cookie tasks are handled asynchronously. Tasks may be deferred if
// all affected cookies are not yet loaded from the backing store. Otherwise,
// the callback may be invoked immediately (prior to return of the asynchronous
// function).
//
// A cookie task is either pending loading of the entire cookie store, or
// loading of cookies for a specfic domain key(eTLD+1). In the former case, the
// cookie task will be queued in tasks_pending_ while PersistentCookieStore
// chain loads the cookie store on DB thread. In the latter case, the cookie
// task will be queued in tasks_pending_for_key_ while PermanentCookieStore
// loads cookies for the specified domain key(eTLD+1) on DB thread.
//
// Callbacks are guaranteed to be invoked on the calling thread.
//
// TODO(deanm) Implement CookieMonster, the cookie database.

  // Terminology:
  //    * The 'top level domain' (TLD) of an internet domain name is
  //      the terminal "." free substring (e.g. "com" for google.com
  //      or world.std.com).
  //    * The 'effective top level domain' (eTLD) is the longest
  //      "." initiated terminal substring of an internet domain name
  //      that is controlled by a general domain registrar.
  //      (e.g. "co.uk" for news.bbc.co.uk).
  //    * The 'effective top level domain plus one' (eTLD+1) is the
  //      shortest "." delimited terminal substring of an internet
  //      domain name that is not controlled by a general domain
  //      registrar (e.g. "bbc.co.uk" for news.bbc.co.uk, or
  //      "google.com" for news.google.com).  The general assumption
  //      is that all hosts and domains under an eTLD+1 share some
  //      administrative control.

  // CookieMap is the central data structure of the CookieMonster.  It
  // is a map whose values are pointers to CanonicalCookie data
  // structures (the data structures are owned by the CookieMonster
  // and must be destroyed when removed from the map).  The key is based on the
  // effective domain of the cookies.  If the domain of the cookie has an
  // eTLD+1, that is the key for the map.  If the domain of the cookie does not
  // have an eTLD+1, the key of the map is the host the cookie applies to (it is
  // not legal to have domain cookies without an eTLD+1).  This rule
  // excludes cookies for, e.g, ".com", ".co.uk", or ".internalnetwork".
  // This behavior is the same as the behavior in Firefox v 3.6.10.

  // NOTE(deanm):
  // I benchmarked hash_multimap vs multimap.  We're going to be query-heavy
  // so it would seem like hashing would help.  However they were very
  // close, with multimap being a tiny bit faster.  I think this is because
  // our map is at max around 1000 entries, and the additional complexity
  // for the hashing might not overcome the O(log(1000)) for querying
  // a multimap.  Also, multimap is standard, another reason to use it.
  // TODO(rdsmith): This benchmark should be re-done now that we're allowing
  // subtantially more entries in the map.
