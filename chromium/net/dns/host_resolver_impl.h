// For each hostname that is requested, HostResolver creates a
// HostResolverImpl::Job. When this job gets dispatched it creates a ProcTask
// which runs the given HostResolverProc on a WorkerPool thread. If requests for
// that same host are made during the job's lifetime, they are attached to the
// existing job rather than creating a new one. This avoids doing parallel
// resolves for the same host.
//
// The way these classes fit together is illustrated by:
//
//
//            +----------- HostResolverImpl -------------+
//            |                    |                     |

//
// When a HostResolverImpl::Job finishes, the callbacks of each waiting request
// are run on the origin thread.
//
// Thread safety: This class is not threadsafe, and must only be called
// from one thread!
//
// The HostResolverImpl enforces limits on the maximum number of concurrent
// threads using PrioritizedDispatcher::Limits.
//
// Jobs are ordered in the queue based on their priority and order of arrival.
