// This file consolidates all the return codes for the browser and renderer

// a) is returned by main() or winmain(), or
// b) specified in the call for ExitProcess() or TerminateProcess(), or
// c) the exception value that causes a process to terminate.
//
// It is advisable to not use negative numbers because the Windows API returns
// it as an unsigned long and the exception values have high numbers. For
// example EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION value is 0xC0000005.
