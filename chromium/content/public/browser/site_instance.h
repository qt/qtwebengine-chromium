///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// SiteInstance interface.
//
// A SiteInstance represents a group of web pages that may be able to
// synchronously script each other, and thus must live in the same renderer
// process.
//
// We identify this group using a combination of where the page comes from
// (the site) and which tabs have references to each other (the instance).
// Here, a "site" is similar to the page's origin, but it only includes the
// registered domain name and scheme, not the port or subdomains.  This accounts
// for the fact that changes to document.domain allow similar origin pages with
// different ports or subdomains to script each other.  An "instance" includes
// all tabs that might be able to script each other because of how they were
// created (e.g., window.open or targeted links).  We represent instances using
// the BrowsingInstance class.
//
// Process models:
//
// In process-per-site-instance (the current default process model),
// SiteInstances are created (1) when the user manually creates a new tab
// (which also creates a new BrowsingInstance), and (2) when the user navigates
// across site boundaries (which uses the same BrowsingInstance).  If the user
// navigates within a site, the same SiteInstance is used.
// (Caveat: we currently allow renderer-initiated cross-site navigations to
// stay in the same SiteInstance, to preserve compatibility in cases like
// cross-site iframes that open popups.)
//
// In --process-per-tab, SiteInstances are created when the user manually
// creates a new tab, but not when navigating across site boundaries (unless
// a process swap is required for security reasons, such as navigating from
// a privileged WebUI page to a normal web page).  This corresponds to one
// process per BrowsingInstance.
//
// In --process-per-site, we consolidate all SiteInstances for a given site into
// the same process, throughout the entire browser context.  This ensures that
// only one process will be used for each site.
//
// Each NavigationEntry for a WebContents points to the SiteInstance that
// rendered it.  Each RenderViewHost also points to the SiteInstance that it is
// associated with.  A SiteInstance keeps track of the number of these
// references and deletes itself when the count goes to zero.  This means that
// a SiteInstance is only live as long as it is accessible, either from new
// tabs with no NavigationEntries or in NavigationEntries in the history.
//
