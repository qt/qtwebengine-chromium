Let's make a story. Add one sentence for every commit: 

CHAPTER 1:
It was a dark and blinky night; the rain fell in torrents -- except at
occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which
swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along
the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that
struggled against the elements. A hooded figure emerged.

It was a Domo-Kun.

"What took you so long?", inquired his wife.

Silence. Oblivious to his silence, she continued, "Did Mr. Usagi enjoy the
waffles you brought him?" "You know him, he's not one to forego a waffle,
no matter how burnt," he snickered.

The pause was filled with the sound of compile errors.

CHAPTER 2:
The jelly was as dark as night, and just as runny.
The Domo-Kun shuddered, remembering the way Mr. Usagi had speared his waffles
with his fork, watching the runny jelly spread and pool across his plate,
like the blood of a dying fawn. "It reminds me of that time --" he started, as
his wife cut in quickly: "-- please. I can't bear to hear it.". A flury of
images coming from the past flowed through his mind.

"You recall what happened on Mulholland drive?" The ceiling fan rotated slowly
overhead, barely disturbing the thick cigarette smoke. No doubt was left about
when the fan was last cleaned.

There was a poignant pause.

CHAPTER 3:
Mr. Usagi felt that something wasn't right. Shortly after the Domo-Kun left he
began feeling sick. He thought out loud to himself, "No, he wouldn't have done
that to me." He considered that perhaps he shouldn't have pushed so hard.
Perhaps he shouldn't have been so cold and sarcastic, after the unimaginable
horror that had occurred just the week before.

Next time, there won't be any sushi. Why sushi with waffles anyway?  It's like
adorning breakfast cereal with halibut -- shameful.

CHAPTER 4:
The taste of stale sushi in his mouth the next morning was unbearable. He
wondered where the sushi came from as he attempted to wash the taste away with
a bottle of 3000Â¥ sake. He tries to recall the cook's face.  Purple?

CHAPTER 5:
Many tears later, Mr. Usagi would laugh at the memory of the earnest,
well-intentioned Domo-Kun. Another day in the life. That is whe he realized that
life goes on.
