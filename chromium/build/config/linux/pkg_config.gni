# Defines a config specifying the result of running pkg-config for the given
# packages. Put the package names you want to query in the "packages" variable
# inside the template invocation.
#
# You can also add defines via the "defines" variable. This can be useful to
# add this to the config to pass defines that the library expects to get by
# users of its headers.

# Example:
#   pkg_config("mything") {
#     packages = [ "mything1", "mything2" ]
#     defines = [ "ENABLE_AWESOME" ]
#   }
