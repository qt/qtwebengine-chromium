// An AXTreeUpdate is a serialized representation of an atomic change
// to an AXTree. The sender and receiver must be in sync; the update
// is only meant to bring the tree from a specific previous state into
// its next state. Trying to apply it to the wrong tree should immediately
// die with a fatal assertion.
//
// An AXTreeUpdate consists of an optional node id to clear (meaning
// that all of that node's children and their descendants are deleted),
// followed by an ordered vector of AXNodeData structures to be applied
// to the tree in order.
//
// Suppose that the next AXNodeData to be applied is |node|. The following
// invariants must hold:
// 1. Either |node.id| is already in the tree, or else the tree is empty,
//        |node| is the new root of the tree, and
//        |node.role| == WebAXRoleRootWebArea.
// 2. Every child id in |node.child_ids| must either be already a child
//        of this node, or a new id not previously in the tree. It is not
//        allowed to "reparent" a child to this node without first removing
//        that child from its previous parent.
// 3. When a new id appears in |node.child_ids|, the tree should create a
//        new uninitialized placeholder node for it immediately. That
//        placeholder must be updated within the same AXTreeUpdate, otherwise
//        it's a fatal error. This guarantees the tree is always complete
//        before or after an AXTreeUpdate.
