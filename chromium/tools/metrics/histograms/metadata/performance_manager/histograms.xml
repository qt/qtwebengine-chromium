<histogram name="PerformanceManager.Experimental.AccessibilityModeFlag"
    enum="AccessibilityModeFlagEnum" expires_after="2023-10-21">
  <owner>anthonyvd@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-catan@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether individual accessibility mode flags are set. Recorded with every UMA
    report to attempt to slice other metrics based on which a11y flags are set.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PerformanceManager.Experimental.HasAccessibilityModeFlag"
    enum="Boolean" expires_after="2023-10-21">
  <owner>anthonyvd@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-catan@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether any accessibility mode flags are set. Recorded with every UMA report
    to attempt to slice other metrics based on whether a11y is active.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PerformanceManager.UserTuning.BatterySaverModeEnabledPercent"
    units="%" expires_after="2023-10-28">
  <owner>anthonyvd@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-catan@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Recorded every UMA upload, this histogram represents the percentage of the
    interval since the last upload that was spent with Battery Saver enabled.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PerformanceManager.UserTuning.EfficiencyMode"
    enum="EfficiencyMode" expires_after="2023-11-12">
  <owner>anthonyvd@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-catan@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged on each UMA upload to represent which user-controllable Efficiency
    Mode setting the browser is in during the reported window. If the mode was
    changed between uploads, MIXED will be reported for that interval.

    This histogram is used internally to filter other histograms by efficiency
    mode.

    units="%" expires_after="2023-10-28">
  <owner>anthonyvd@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-catan@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Recorded every UMA upload, this histogram represents the percentage of the
    interval since the last upload that was spent with Memory Saver enabled.

  <owner>chrome-catan@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Logged every time V8DetailedMemoryReporter.GetV8MemoryUsage is sent to a
    renderer, with the measurement mode. This can be used to find the volume of
    measurement requests to track their performance overhead.
