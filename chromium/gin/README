Gin - Lightweight bindings for V8
=================================

This directory contains gin, a lightweight bindings library for V8. These
bindings are not compatible with the V8 bindings used by Blink because both
want to control the v8::Isolate's internal data field. Maybe in some future
world we'll refactor the Blink V8 bindings to use this system. In the meantime,
these bindings are convenient for projects other than Blink that use V8.
