// Class used by VideoCaptureDeviceMac (VCDM) for video capture using
// AVFoundation API. This class lives inside the thread created by its owner
// VCDM.
//
//  * Clients (VCDM) should call +deviceNames to fetch the list of devices
//    available in the system; this method returns the list of device names that
//    have to be used with -setCaptureDevice:.
//  * Previous to any use, clients (VCDM) must call -initWithFrameReceiver: to
//    initialise an object of this class and register a |frameReceiver_|.
//  * Frame receiver registration or removal can also happen via explicit call
//    to -setFrameReceiver:. Re-registrations are safe and allowed, even during
//    capture using this method.
//  * Method -setCaptureDevice: must be called at least once with a device
//    identifier from +deviceNames. Creates all the necessary AVFoundation
//    objects on first call; it connects them ready for capture every time.
//    This method should not be called during capture (i.e. between
//    -startCapture and -stopCapture).
//  * -setCaptureWidth:height:frameRate: is called if a resolution or frame rate
//    different than the by default one set by -setCaptureDevice: is needed.
//    This method should not be called during capture. This method must be
//    called after -setCaptureDevice:.
//  * -startCapture registers the notification listeners and starts the
//    capture. The capture can be stop using -stopCapture. The capture can be
//    restarted and restoped multiple times, reconfiguring or not the device in
//    between.
//  * -setCaptureDevice can be called with a |nil| value, case in which it stops
//    the capture and disconnects the library objects. This step is not
//    necessary.
//  * Deallocation of the library objects happens gracefully on destruction of
//    the VideoCaptureDeviceAVFoundation object.
