-- A 'thread_executing_span' is thread_state span starting with a runnable slice
-- until the next runnable slice that's woken up by a process (as opposed
-- to an interrupt). Note that within a 'thread_executing_span' we can have sleep
-- spans blocked on an interrupt.
-- We consider the id of this span to be the id of the first thread_state in the span.

--
-- Finds all runnable states that are woken up by a process.
--
-- We achieve this by checking that the |thread_state.irq_context|
-- value is NOT 1. In otherwords, it is either 0 or NULL. The NULL check
-- is important to support older Android versions.
--
-- On older versions of Android (<U). We don't have IRQ context information,
-- so this table might contain wakeups from interrupt context, consequently, the
-- wakeup graph generated might not be accurate.
