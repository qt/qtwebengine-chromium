// DESCRIPTION
// QuantizedAllocation::quantizedSize() rounds up the specific size such that:
// 1) Granularity of allocation sizes is >1, and grows as a fraction of the
// allocation size. This property can be used to limit bucket fragmentation
// when sitting on top of a high-granularity allocator such as PartitionAlloc.
// 2) The sizes are likely (but not guaranteed) to correspond to exact "bucket
// sizes" of any underlying allocator that implements standard bucketing.
// This currently includes tcmalloc, Windows LFH and PartitionAlloc.

#include "wtf/WTFExport.h"
#include <limits.h>

    // This is the minimum granularity of allocation, currently 8 bytes.
