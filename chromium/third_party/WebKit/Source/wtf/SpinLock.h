// DESCRIPTION
// spinLockLock() and spinLockUnlock() are simple spinlock primitives based on
// the standard CPU primitive of atomic increment and decrement of an int at
// a given memory address.

#include "wtf/Atomics.h"

ALWAYS_INLINE void spinLockLock(int volatile* lock)
{
    while (atomicTestAndSetToOne(lock)) {
        while (*lock) { } // Spin without spamming locked instructions.
    }
}

ALWAYS_INLINE void spinLockUnlock(int volatile* lock)
{
    atomicSetOneToZero(lock);
}

} // namespace WTF
