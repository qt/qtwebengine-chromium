# In this dictionary, each item stores:
# * port_name -- a fully qualified port name
# * rebaseline_override_dir -- (optional) directory to put baselines in instead of where you would normally put them.
#      This is useful when we don't have bots that cover particular configurations; so, e.g., you might
#      support mac-mountainlion but not have a mac-mountainlion bot yet, so you'd want to put the mac-lion
#      results into platform/mac temporarily.
