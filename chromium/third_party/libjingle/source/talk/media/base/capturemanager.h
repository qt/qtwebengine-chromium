// The CaptureManager class manages VideoCapturers to make it possible to share
// the same VideoCapturers across multiple instances. E.g. if two instances of
// some class want to listen to same VideoCapturer they can't individually stop
// and start capturing as doing so will affect the other instance.
// The class employs reference counting on starting and stopping of capturing of
// frames such that if anyone is still listening it will not be stopped. The
// class also provides APIs for attaching VideoRenderers to a specific capturer
// such that the VideoRenderers are fed frames directly from the capturer. In
// addition, these frames can be altered before being sent to the capturers by
// way of VideoProcessors.
// CaptureManager is Thread-unsafe. This means that none of its APIs may be
// called concurrently. Note that callbacks are called by the VideoCapturer's
// thread which is normally a separate unmarshalled thread and thus normally
// require lock protection.
