Local Modifications:
This only includes the jinja2 directory from the tarball and the LICENSE and
AUTHORS files. Unit tests (testsuite directory) have been removed.
Additional chromium-specific files are:
* README.chromium (this file)
* OWNERS
* install script (get_jinja2.sh)
* files of hashes (MD5 is also posted on website, SHA-512 computed locally).
Script checks hash then unpacks archive and installs desired files.
Retrieve or update by executing jinja2/get_jinja2.sh from third_party.
