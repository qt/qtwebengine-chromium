This crate was originally forked from crates.io: https://github.com/droundy/arrayref

This fork removes unsafe code which is no longer needed in stable rust while
keeping the behavior the same. The owner of the upstream repo has been unresponsive with regards to landing these changes upstream ie: https://github.com/droundy/arrayref/pull/24
