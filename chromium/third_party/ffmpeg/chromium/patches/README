Current Status as of Aug 22, 2013


Upstream cherry-picks:

Current patches:

to_upstream/
unblock_windows_build.patch
  wolenetz: MSVC fails to detect that abort() in av_assert0(0) occurs in
  all code paths in lavc/utils.c avcodec_default_reget_buffer().  This patch
  includes an explicit return AVERROR_BUG after the assert to unblock
  the build when MSVC is configured to treat all warnings as errors.

w32pthreads_xp_fixes_and_vp8_workaround.patch
  dalecurtis: pthreads emulation incorrectly assumed Vista+.  Additionally due
  to use of static variables in header file, duplicate initialization is needed.
  reported upstream which is working on a proper fix.


ugly/
01_enable_checked_bitstream.patch
  dalecurtis: Removes "#define UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER 1" from all codecs
  defining it. In Chromium, all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

02_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  dalecurtis: Add CONFIG_* checks to compile out code which we don't use which
  might be a security risk.  Discuss with cevans before removing.  Upstream does
  not want this patch.
  wolenetz: In M27 merge, added call to matroska_read_close(s) in to this patch
  in matroska_read_header() to mitigate memory leak caught by valgrind.
  Confirmed with rbultje that this conforms to API (on error in
  matroska_read_header(), resulting state should be same as prior to call; and
  no double-free is expected to result from this either.)

compile_with_no_iconv.patch
  wolenetz: When CONFIG_ICONV is 0, the original code path did not return a
  value, causing compile failure on Windows.  It also aborted via an assert.
  This patch enables compiling by returning an appropriate error code and also
  removes the assert and abort.

undeprecate_destruct_packet_api.patch
  wolenetz: Until upstream fully deprecates usage of FF_API_DESTRUCT_PACKET and
  we switch to using refcounted AVBuffer API, this patch is necessary.
  See http://crbug.com/236611

preserve_m27_avcodecids.patch
  wolenetz: Insert a deprecated placeholder into AVCodecID enum such that
  the resulting IDs are either new IDs since M27 or have same enumeration as
  M27.  This is specific to the M29 roll.
  See https://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/ticket/2575

disable_pix_fmt_desc_api.patch
  dalecurtis: Disable unused API to avoid deprecatation warnings.  Remove once
  libavutil version > 52.
