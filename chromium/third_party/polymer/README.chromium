Description:
This directory contains a copy of polymer.min.js file. It is a minified version
of javascript library Polymer. Polymer is comprised of two efforts:
1. A set of core platform features (Shadow DOM, Custom Elements, MDV).
Initially, these core features will be enabled with a set of polyfills. As
browsers begin to implement these new primitives, the polyfill platform layer
becomes smaller and better over time.
2. A next-generation web application framework built upon these core
technologies called the Polymer.

This is downloaded from polymer stable release
(https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/releases). See build.log and README.md for
how the minified file is generated.
