Description:
This directory contains i386 and amd64 binaries of the gold linker from GNU
binutils.  They were built from binutils-2.23.1 on Ubuntu Lucid as follows:

1) Fetch tarball: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.23.1.tar.bz2
2) Unpack, then
    ./configure --enable-gold=default --enable-threads
3) make maybe-all-gold && strip gold/ld-new
4) mv gold/ld-new path/to/this/dir/gold64 (or gold32)

To build on a non-Lucid (e.g. Precise) machine, or to build the 32-bit binary
on a 64-bit machine, a chroot can be used by running the following commands as
root (swap i386 for amd64 as needed):

  debootstrap --arch=i386 --include=build-essential,flex,bison \
    lucid i386-lucid
  chroot i386-lucid

Then follow steps 1-4 above.

(ld.bfd is a forwarding script that is in place because the NaCl build
depends on there being a script with that name in the same directory as
ld.)
