Description:
Alternative to SQLite used as the backend for IndexedDB and internally by the
FileSystem API implementation and others.

Local Additions:
* gyp file for building in chromium
* port/port_chromium.{h,cc} and env_chromium.{h,cc} provide chromium
  implementations of primitives used by leveldb.  E.g. threading, file handling,
  etc. env_chromium.h allows re-use of some utility functions.
* chromium_logger.h was copied from src/util/posix_logger.h and updated to use
  chrome primitives in place of some posix primitives
* env_idb.h allows IndexedDB to emit uma stats under separate histograms from
  other LevelDB consumers.
* ChromiumEnv wraps low-level I/O calls that may be interrupted with a
  HANDLE_EINTR macro that retries the call.
* TRACE macros/thread name for chrome://tracing diagnostics
