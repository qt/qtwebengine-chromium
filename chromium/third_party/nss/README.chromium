Description:
NSS 3.15.3 with NSPR 4.10.2

This copy of NSS has been customized for Chromium.  NSPR is also put here
rather than in a separate directory to emphasize the fact that Chromium is
using NSPR strictly as an NSS dependency.

We took a subset of NSS, omitting the SSL and SMIME libraries and the
built-in root CA certificates module.  This NSS subset satisfies the
dependencies of the NSS SSL library in src/net/third_party/nss.  Do NOT use
this copy of NSS on platforms that have NSS as system libraries, such as
Linux.

The source code was checked out from the mozilla.org CVS or hg repository using
the nspr-checkout.sh and nss-checkout.sh scripts in the scripts directory.
The current source code was checked out with the hg tag NSS_3_15_3_RTM
and the hg tag NSPR_4_10_2_RTM.

Local Modifications:

We made the following local changes to NSPR.
- patches/nspr-static.patch: to build NSPR as static libraries.  See NSPR
  bug 533014 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=533014).
- patches/prcpucfg.h: added to the nspr/pr/include directory.
- patches/nspr-attach-as-system-thread.patch: attach a "foreign" thread
  (a thread not created by NSPR) to NSPR as a "system" thread rather than
  a "user" thread, which needs to terminate before PR_Cleanup can return.
  (The "system" vs. "user" thread distinction comes from Java, and
  ultimately from Solaris threads.)  This is a workaround for
  http://crbug.com/40663.
- patches/nspr-remove-io.patch: Remove IO operations in NSPR to allow NSS
  to work in the sandbox.  Do not initialize IO when initializing NSPR.
  Windows version of NSPR also tried to use getaddrinfo to resolve hostname
  in a SSL connection.  By removing _PR_HAVE_GETADDRINFO this will force it
  to use PR_GetHostByName.  Removing _PR_INET6_PROBE will prevent it from
  creating an IPv6 socket to probe if IPv6 is there.
  DO NOT upstream this patch.
- patches/nspr-disable-optimization-2013.patch Disable optimizations on VS2013
  in prdtoa.c. The compiler bug is fixed upstream and this can be removed on
  next compiler update.

We made the following local changes to NSS.
- patches/nss-static.patch: to build NSS as static libraries and omit
  libpkix (the new certification path validation library) and
  softoken/legacydb (support for the old Berkeley DB databases).  See NSS
  bug 534471 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=534471).
- nss/exports_win.def: The list of exports to use when building nss as a
  dynamic library (crnss.dll).
- nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.c: a generated file. Do an upstream NSS
  build and copy the generated certdata.c.
- nss/lib/freebl/build_config_mac.h: a header that defines the target arch
  specific configuration macros for lib/freebl on iOS and Mac OS X. This
  works around the lack of support for the xcode_settings
  GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS[arch=foo] by the ninja GYP generator
  (http://crbug.com/122592).
- nss/lib/freebl/mpi/mpi_arm_mac.c: a wrapper file for mpi_arm.c for iOS
  and Mac OS X. This works around the inability to specify target arch
  specific source files in Xcode. 
- patches/nss-remove-fortezza.patch: remove Fortezza certificate support
  from PK11_ImportPublicKey.  See NSS bug 668397
  (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=668397).
- patches/nss-urandom-abort.patch: call abort() if NSS cannot read from
  /dev/urandom.  See Chromium issue 244661 (http://crbug.com/244661).
- patches/nss-chacha20-poly1305.patch: Support ChaCha20+Poly1305 cipher
  suites.  See NSS bug 917571
  (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=917571).
