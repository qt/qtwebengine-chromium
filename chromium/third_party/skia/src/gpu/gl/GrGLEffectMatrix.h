 * This is a helper to implement a matrix in a GrGLEffect that operates on incoming coords in the
 * vertex shader and writes them to an attribute to be used in the fragment shader. When the input
 * coords in the vertex shader are local coordinates this class accounts for the coord change matrix
 * communicated via GrDrawEffect. The input coords may also be positions and in this case the coord
 * change matrix is ignored. The GrGLEffectMatrix will emit different code based on the type of
 * matrix and thus must contribute to the effect's key.
 *
 * This class cannot be used to apply a matrix to coordinates that come in the form of custom vertex
 * attributes.
