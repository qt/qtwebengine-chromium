Description:
This is the API to talk to the Google Cache Invalidation service.

Local Modifications:
None.

Note: If you are rolling forward the Cache Invalidation API version, and want to
check if any changes need to be made to cacheinvalidation.gyp, do the following:

  cd src/third_party/cacheinvalidation/src
  git remote update
  git diff --diff-filter=ACDR --name-only origin/master | grep -v ^java/

This should give you a list of relevant files that were added, copied, renamed
or deleted upstream. You will likely need to make appropriate changes to
cacheinvalidation.gyp to keep the build green.
