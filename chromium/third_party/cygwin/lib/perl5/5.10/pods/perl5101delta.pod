=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.10.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.10.0 release and
the 5.10.1 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.8.8, first read
the L<perl5100delta>, which describes differences between 5.8.8 and
5.10.0

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=over

=item *

The semantics of C<use feature :5.10*> have changes slightly.
See L<"Modules and Pragmata"> for more information.

=item *

It is now a run-time error to use the smart match operator C<~~>
with an object that has no overload defined for it. (This way
C<~~> will not break encapsulation by matching against the
object's internal representation as a reference.)

=over

=item C<feature>

The meaning of the C<:5.10> and C<:5.10.X> feature bundles has
changed slightly. The last component, if any (ie C<X>) is simply ignored.
This is predicated on the assumption that new features will not, in
general, be added to maintenance releases. So  C<:5.10> and C<:5.10.X>
have identical effect. This is a change to the behaviour documented for
5.10.0.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://bugs.perl.org/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
