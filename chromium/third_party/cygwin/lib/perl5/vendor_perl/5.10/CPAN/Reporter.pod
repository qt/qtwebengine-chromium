=head1 NAME

CPAN::Reporter - Adds CPAN Testers reporting to CPAN.pm

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 1.13.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

From the CPAN shell:

  cpan> install CPAN::Reporter
  cpan> reload cpan
  cpan> o conf init test_report

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The CPAN Testers project captures and analyses detailed results from building
and testing CPAN distributions on multiple operating systems and multiple
versions of Perl.  This provides valuable feedback to module authors and
potential users to identify bugs or platform compatibility issues and improves
the overall quality and value of CPAN.

One way individuals can contribute is to send a report for each module that
they test or install.  CPAN::Reporter is an add-on for the CPAN.pm module to
send the results of building and testing modules to the CPAN Testers project.
Full support for CPAN::Reporter is available in CPAN.pm as of version 1.92.

=head1 GETTING STARTED

=head2 Installation

The first step in using CPAN::Reporter is to install it using whatever
version of CPAN.pm is already installed.  CPAN.pm will be upgraded as
a dependency if necessary.

  cpan> install CPAN::Reporter

If CPAN.pm was upgraded, it needs to be reloaded.

  cpan> reload cpan

=head2 Configuration

If upgrading from a very old version of CPAN.pm, users may be prompted to renew
their configuration settings, including the 'test_report' option to enable
CPAN::Reporter.  

If not prompted automatically, users should manually initialize CPAN::Reporter
support.  After enabling CPAN::Reporter, CPAN.pm will automatically continue
with interactive configuration of CPAN::Reporter options.

  cpan> o conf init test_report

Users will need to enter an email address in one of the following formats:

  johndoe@example.com
  John Doe <johndoe@example.com>
  "John Q. Public" <johnqpublic@example.com>

Because C<<< cpan-testers >>> uses a mailing list to collect test reports, it is
helpful if the email address provided is subscribed to the list.  Otherwise,
test reports will be held until manually reviewed and approved.  Subscribing an
account to the cpan-testers list is as easy as sending a blank email to
cpan-testers-subscribe@perl.org and replying to the confirmation email.

Users will also be prompted to enter the name of an outbound email server.  It
is recommended to use an email server provided by the user's ISP or company.
Alternatively, leave this blank to attempt to send email directly to perl.org.

Users that are new to CPAN::Reporter should accept the recommended values
for other configuration options.

After completing interactive configuration, be sure to commit (save) the CPAN
configuration changes.

  cpan> o conf commit

See L<CPAN::Reporter::Config> for advanced configuration settings.

=head2 Using CPAN::Reporter

Once CPAN::Reporter is enabled and configured, test or install modules with
CPAN.pm as usual.  

For example, to force CPAN to repeat tests for CPAN::Reporter to see how it
works:

  cpan> force test CPAN::Reporter

When distribution tests fail, users will be prompted to edit the report to add
addition information.

=head1 UNDERSTANDING TEST GRADES

CPAN::Reporter will assign one of the following grades to the report:

=over

=item *

C<<< pass >>> -- all tests were successful  

=back

=over

=item *

C<<< fail >>> -- one or more tests failed, one or more test files died during
testing or no test output was seen

=back

=over

=item *

C<<< na >>> -- tests could not be run on this platform or version of perl

=back

=over

=item *

C<<< unknown >>> -- no test files could be found (either tE<sol>*.t or test.pl) or 
a result could not be determined from test output (e.g tests may have hung 
and been interrupted)

=back

In returning results to CPAN.pm, "pass" and "unknown" are considered successful
attempts to "make test" or "Build test" and will not prevent installation.
"fail" and "na" are considered to be failures and CPAN.pm will not install
unless forced.

If prerequisites specified in C<<< Makefile.PL >>> or C<<< Build.PL >>> are not available,
no report will be generated and a failure will be signaled to CPAN.pm.

=head1 PRIVACY WARNING

CPAN::Reporter includes information in the test report about environment
variables and special Perl variables that could be affecting test results in
order to help module authors interpret the results of the tests.  This includes
information about paths, terminal, locale, userE<sol>group ID, installed toolchain
modules (e.g. ExtUtils::MakeMaker) and so on.  

These have been intentionally limited to items that should not cause harmful
personal information to be revealed -- it does I<not> include your entire
environment.  Nevertheless, please do not use CPAN::Reporter if you are
concerned about the disclosure of this information as part of your test report.  

Users wishing to review this information may choose to edit the report 
prior to sending it.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature using the CPAN Request Tracker.  
Bugs can be submitted through the web interface at 
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=CPAN-Reporter>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch to an
existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
