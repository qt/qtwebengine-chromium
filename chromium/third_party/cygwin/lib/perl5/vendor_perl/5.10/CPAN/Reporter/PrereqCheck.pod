=head1 NAME

CPAN::Reporter::PrereqCheck - Modulino for prerequisite tests

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 1.13.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  require CPAN::Reporter::PrereqCheck;
  my $prereq_check = $INC{'CPAN/Reporter/PrereqCheck.pm'};
  my $result = qx/$perl $prereq_check < $prereq_file/;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This modulino determines whether a list of prerequisite modules are
available and, if so, their version number.  It is designed to be run
as a script in order to provide this information from the perspective of
a subprocess, just like CPAN::Reporter's invocation of C<<< perl Makefile.PL >>>
and so on.

It reads a module name and prerequisite string pair from each line of input
and prints out the module name, 0 or 1 depending on whether the prerequisite
is satisifed, and the installed module version.  If the module is not
available, it will print "nE<sol>a" for the version.  If the module is available
but can't be loaded, it will print "broken" for the version.  Modules 
without a version will be treated as being of version "0".

No user serviceable parts are inside.  This modulino is packaged for 
internal use by CPAN::Reporter.
