=head1 NAME

CPAN::Reporter::History - Read or write a CPAN::Reporter history log

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 1.13

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use CPAN::Reporter::History 'have_tested';
 
     @results = have_tested( dist => 'Dist-Name-1.23' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Interface for interacting with the CPAN::Reporter history file.  Most methods
are private for use only within CPAN::Reporter itself.  However, a public
function is provided to query the history file for results. 

=head1 USAGE

The following function is available.  It is not exported by default.

=head2 C<<< have_tested() >>>

     # all reports for Foo-Bar-1.23
     @results = have_tested( dist => 'Foo-Bar-1.23' );
 
     # all NA reports
     @results = have_tested( grade => 'NA' );
 
     # all reports on the current Perl/platform
     @results = have_tested();

Searches the CPAN::Reporter history file for records exactly matching search
criteria, given as pairs of field-names and desired values.  

Ordinary search criteria include:

=over

=item *

C<<< dist >>> -- the distribution tarball name without any filename suffix; from 
a C<<< CPAN::Distribution >>> object, this is provided by the C<<< base_id >>> method.

=item *

C<<< phase >>> -- phase the report was generated during: either 'PL', 
'make' or 'test'

=item *

C<<< grade >>> -- CPAN Testers grade: 'PASS', 'FAIL', 'NA' or'UNKNOWN'; Also may
be 'DISCARD' for any failing reports not sent due to missing prerequisites

=back

Without additional criteria, a search will be limited to the current
version of Perl and the current architecture and OS version.  
Additional criteria may be specified explicitly or, by specifying the empty 
string, C<<< q{} >>>, will match that field for I<any> record.

     # all reports for Foo-Bar-1.23 on any version of perl 
     # on the current architecture and OS version
     @results = have_tested( dist => 'Foo-Bar-1.23', perl => q{} );

These additional criteria include:

=over

=item *

C<<< perl >>> -- perl version and possible patchlevel; this will be
dotted decimal (5.6.2) starting with version 5.6, or will be numeric style as
given by C<<< $] >>> for older versions; if a patchlevel exists, it must be specified
similar to "5.11.0 patch 12345"

=item *

C<<< archname >>> -- platform architecture name as given by $Config{archname}

=item *

C<<< osvers >>> -- operating system version as given by $Config{osvers}

=back

The function returns an array of hashes representing each test result, with
all of the fields listed above.
