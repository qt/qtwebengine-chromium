=head1 NAME

IO::CaptureOutput - capture STDOUT and STDERR from Perl code, subprocesses or XS

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 1.0801.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use IO::CaptureOutput qw(capture capture_exec);
 
     my ($stdout, $stderr);
 
     sub noisy {
         warn "this sub prints to stdout and stderr!";
         print "arguments: @_";
     }
 
     capture { noisy(@args) } \$stdout, \$stderr;
 
     ($stdout, $stderr) = capture_exec( 'perl', '-e', 
         'print "Hello"; print STDERR "World!"');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides routines for capturing STDOUT and STDERR from perl 
subroutines, forked system calls (e.g. C<<< system() >>>, C<<< fork() >>>) and from 
XS or C modules.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following functions will be exported on demand.

=head2 capture()

     capture \&subroutine, \$stdout, \$stderr;

Captures everything printed to C<<< STDOUT >>> and C<<< STDERR >>> for the duration of
C<<< &subroutine >>>. C<<< $stdout >>> and C<<< $stderr >>> are optional scalars that will contain
C<<< STDOUT >>> and C<<< STDERR >>> respectively. 

C<<< capture() >>> uses a code prototype so the first argument can be specified directly within 
brackets if desired.

     # shorthand with prototype
     capture { print __PACKAGE__ } \$stdout, \$stderr;

Returns the return value(s) of C<<< &subroutine >>>. The sub is called in the same
context as C<<< capture() >>> was called e.g.:

     @rv = capture { wantarray } ; # returns true
     $rv = capture { wantarray } ; # returns defined, but not true
     capture { wantarray };       # void, returns undef

C<<< capture() >>> is able to capture output from subprocesses and C code, which
traditional C<<< tie() >>> methods of output capture are unable to do.

B<Note:> C<<< capture() >>> will only capture output that has been written or flushed
to the filehandle.

If the two scalar references refer to the same scalar, then C<<< STDERR >>> will be
merged to C<<< STDOUT >>> before capturing and the scalar will hold the combined
output of both.

     capture \&subroutine, \$combined, \$combined;

Normally, C<<< capture() >>> uses anonymous, temporary files for capturing output.
If desired, specific file names may be provided instead as additional options.

     capture \&subroutine, \$stdout, \$stderr, $out_file, $err_file;

Files provided will be clobbered, overwriting any previous data, but
will persist after the call to C<<< capture() >>> for inspection or other manipulation.

By default, when no references are provided to hold STDOUT or STDERR, output
is captured and silently discarded.

     # Capture STDOUT, discard STDERR
     capture \&subroutine, \$stdout;
 
     # Discard STDOUT, capture STDERR
     capture \&subroutine, undef, \$stderr;

If either STDOUT or STDERR should be passed through to the terminal instead of
captured, provide a reference to undef -- C<<< \undef >>> -- instead of a capture
variable.

     # Capture STDOUT, display STDERR
     capture \&subroutine, \$stdout, \undef;
 
     # Display STDOUT, capture STDERR
     capture \&subroutine, \undef, \$stderr;

=head2 capture_exec()

     ($stdout, $stderr) = capture_exec(@args);

Captures and returns the output from C<<< system(@args) >>>. In scalar context,
C<<< capture_exec() >>> will return what was printed to C<<< STDOUT >>>. In list context,
it returns what was printed to C<<< STDOUT >>> and C<<< STDERR >>>

     $stdout = capture_exec('perl', '-e', 'print "hello world"');
 
     ($stdout, $stderr) = capture_exec('perl', '-e', 'warn "Test"');

C<<< capture_exec >>> passes its arguments to C<<< system() >>> and on MSWin32 will protect
arguments with shell quotes if necessary.  This makes it a handy and slightly
more portable alternative to backticks, piped C<<< open() >>> and C<<< IPC::Open3 >>>.

You can check the exit status of the C<<< system() >>> call with the C<<< $? >>>
variable. See L<perlvar> for more information.

=head2 capture_exec_combined()

     $combined = capture_exec_combined(
         'perl', '-e', 'print "hello\n"', 'warn "Test\n"
     );

This is just like C<<< capture_exec() >>>, except that it merges C<<< STDERR >>> with C<<< STDOUT >>>
before capturing output and returns a single scalar.

B<Note:> there is no guarantee that text printed to C<<< STDOUT >>> and C<<< STDERR >>> in the
subprocess will be appear in order. The actual order will depend on how IO
buffering is handled in the subprocess.

=head2 qxx()

This is an alias for C<<< capture_exec() >>>.

=head2 qxy()

This is an alias for C<<< capture_exec_combined() >>>.
