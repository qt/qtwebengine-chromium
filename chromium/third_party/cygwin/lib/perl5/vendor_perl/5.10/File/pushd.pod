=head1 NAME

File::pushd - change directory temporarily for a limited scope

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 1.00.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use File::pushd;
 
  chdir $ENV{HOME};
 
  # change directory again for a limited scope
  {
      my $dir = pushd( '/tmp' );
      # working directory changed to /tmp
  }
  # working directory has reverted to $ENV{HOME}
 
  # tempd() is equivalent to pushd( File::Temp::tempdir )
  {
      my $dir = tempd();
  }
 
  # object stringifies naturally as an absolute path
  {
     my $dir = pushd( '/tmp' );
     my $filename = File::Spec->catfile( $dir, "somefile.txt" );
     # gives /tmp/somefile.txt
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

File::pushd does a temporary C<<< chdir >>> that is easily and automatically
reverted, similar to C<<< pushd >>> in some Unix command shells.  It works by
creating an object that caches the original working directory.  When the object
is destroyed, the destructor calls C<<< chdir >>> to revert to the original working
directory.  By storing the object in a lexical variable with a limited scope,
this happens automatically at the end of the scope.

This is very handy when working with temporary directories for tasks like
testing; a function is provided to streamline getting a temporary
directory from L<File::Temp>.

For convenience, the object stringifies as the canonical form of the absolute
pathname of the directory entered.

=head1 USAGE

  use File::pushd;

Using File::pushd automatically imports the C<<< pushd >>> and C<<< tempd >>> functions.

=head2 pushd

  {
      my $dir = pushd( $target_directory );
  }

Caches the current working directory, calls C<<< chdir >>> to change to the target
directory, and returns a File::pushd object.  When the object is
destroyed, the working directory reverts to the original directory.

The provided target directory can be a relative or absolute path. If
called with no arguments, it uses the current directory as its target and
returns to the current directory when the object is destroyed.

=head2 tempd

  {
      my $dir = tempd();
  }

This function is like C<<< pushd >>> but automatically creates and calls C<<< chdir >>> to
a temporary directory created by L<File::Temp>. Unlike normal L<File::Temp>
cleanup which happens at the end of the program, this temporary directory is
removed when the object is destroyed. (But also see C<<< preserve >>>.)  A warning
will be issued if the directory cannot be removed.

=head2 preserve 

  {
      my $dir = tempd();
      $dir->preserve;      # mark to preserve at end of scope
      $dir->preserve(0);   # mark to delete at end of scope
  }

Controls whether a temporary directory will be cleaned up when the object is
destroyed.  With no arguments, C<<< preserve >>> sets the directory to be preserved.
With an argument, the directory will be preserved if the argument is true, or
marked for cleanup if the argument is false.  Only C<<< tempd >>> objects may be
marked for cleanup.  (Target directories to C<<< pushd >>> are always preserved.)
C<<< preserve >>> returns true if the directory will be preserved, and false
otherwise.
