Description:
SCons is an Open Source software construction tool-that is, a next-generation
build tool. Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform substitute for the
classic Make utility with integrated functionality similar to
autoconf/automake and compiler caches such as ccache. In short, SCons is an
easier, more reliable and faster way to build software.

Current local modifications:

scripts/scons - exception handling for importing pkg_resources is broader.
(catch Exception vs. ImportError)  This fixes a problem encountered where the
Mac toolchain bot redefines MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.

Applied workaround from: http://scons.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2449
NOTE: Both python and SCons are NOT planning to fix this, so we will need this
fix even when upgrading to newer versions of scons or python.
