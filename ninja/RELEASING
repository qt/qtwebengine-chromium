Notes to myself on all the steps to make for a Ninja release.

Push new release branch:
1. update src/version.cc with new version (with ".git")
2. git checkout release; git merge master
3. fix version number in src/version.cc (it will likely conflict in the above)
4. fix version in doc/manual.asciidoc
5. commit, tag, push (don't forget to push --tags)
6. construct release notes from prior notes

Release on github:
1. (haven't tried this yet)

Make announcement on mailing list:
1. copy old mail

Update website:
(note to self: website is now in github.com/martine/martine.github.io)
1. rebuild manual, put in place on website
2. update home page mention of latest version.
